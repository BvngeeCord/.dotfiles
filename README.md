# .dotfiles
My dotfiles for Arch Linux :P

This is the cultivation of at least 6 months (as of the time of righting) of effort. It includes countless custom shell scripts, program configuration, custom styling and theming, and more. Scroll through it yourself if you're really curious :P
NOTE: This does not include my current Neovim configuration nor my ZSH config, as I plan to redo both from scratch later on.
